The Full-Stack Development Hub is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate collaboration, version control, and project management for developers across various domains. Much like GitHub, this platform offers users the ability to register, login, create repositories, upload files, and collaborate with other users. However, what sets it apart is its focus on full-stack development, providing dedicated sections for different layers of development, including front-end, back-end, and full-stack projects.
